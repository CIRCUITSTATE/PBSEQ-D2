**PBSEQ-D2** is a simple push-button based power sequencer demo board designed in KiCad. You can press the push-button momentarily to turn on the output. Pressing again will turn off the output. A PMOS transistor is used as a high-side switch to control the power. An NMOS transistor controls the power sequencing. This demo project is fully open-source and you can find the source design files here.

A tutorial of designing and testing the circuit will soon be available at [CIRCUITSTATE](https://www.circuitstate.com/).
